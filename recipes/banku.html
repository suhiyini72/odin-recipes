    <h2>My Favourite Food</h2>
    <p>
    Banku is one of the delicacies love by majority of Ghanaians.<br>
    This is true because every household in Ghana can not live two<br>
    consecutive days without preparing and eating Banku. This makes it<br>
    a routine delicacy.

    Banku food is an aged long delicacy in Ghanaian societies.<br>
    It is believed that Banku food was first prepared by the Hausa<br>
    people when they first arrived in the then Goal Coast.<br>

    food that is prepared and eaten almost everyday.
